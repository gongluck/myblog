### 2.FastCGI

#### 2.1 CGI工作方式

- 传统**CGI**（Common Gateway Interface）方式是客户端有多少个请求，就开辟多少个子进程，每个子进程都需要启动自己的解释器、加载配置，连接其他服务器等初始化工作，这是**CGI**进程性能低下的主要原因。当用户请求非常多的时候，会占用大量的内存、cpu等资源，造成性能低下。

  ![cgi工作方式](https://github.com/gongluck/CVIP/blob/master/images/cgi工作方式.png?raw=true)

- 与为每个请求创建一个新的进程不同，**FastCGI**使用持续的进程来处理一连串的请求。这些进程由 **FastCGI**进程管理器管理，而不是**web**服务器。

  ![fastcgi工作方式](https://github.com/gongluck/CVIP/blob/master/images/fastcgi工作方式.png?raw=true)

- 由于**FastCGI**程序并不需要不断的产生新进程，可以大大降低服务器的压力并且产生较高的应用效率。它的速度效率最少要比**CGI**技术提高5倍以上。它还支持分布式的部署，即**FastCGI**程序可以在**web**服务器以外的主机上执行。

#### 2.2 spawn-fcgi

- **spawn-fcgi**是一个通用的**FastCGI**进程管理器，简单小巧。

- **spawn-fcgi**使用**pre-fork**模型，功能主要是打开监听端口，绑定地址，然后**fork-and-exec**创建我们编写的**FastCGI**应用程序进程，退出完成工作。**FastCGI**应用程序初始化，然后进入死循环侦听**socket**的连接请求。

- 编译安装**spawn-fcgi**

  ```shell
  wget http://download.lighttpd.net/spawn-fcgi/releases-1.6.x/spawn-fcgi-1.6.4.tar.gz
  tar -zxvf spawn-fcgi-1.6.4.tar.gz
  cd spawn-fcgi-1.6.4/
  ./configure
  make -j 8
  sudo make install
  #sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libfcgi.so.0 /usr/lib/libfcgi.so.0
  ```

#### 2.3 fcgi

- 使用**C/C++**编写**FastCGI**应用程序，可以使用**FastCGI**软件开发套件或者其它开发框架，如**fcgi**。

- 编译安装**fcgi**

  ```shell
  wget https://fossies.org/linux/www/old/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
  tar -zxvf fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
  cd fcgi-2.4.0/
  ./configure
  make -j 8
  sudo make install
  ```
